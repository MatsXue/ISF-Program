# ISF-Program
MATLAB Programs for the robotic ISF project

This repository demonstrates two demo programs for the chatter analysis and suppression. The first program 'Trajectory_Generation_Demo.m' shows the MATLAB program for generating the robot manipulator trajectory to conduct the robotic ISF process. The second program 'Eigen_Calculate_Demo' shows the MATLAB program for the mapping of one principle stiffness from the measured Cartesian space stiffness and plotting.

For the other full version of the programs, please approach to Junyuan via email at: xue.junyuan@u.nus.edu
